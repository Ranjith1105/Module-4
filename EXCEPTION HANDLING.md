## EXCEPTION HANDLING

---

### AIM  
To write a Python program that raises a user-defined exception in a guessing number game, where the user has to guess the number 1

---

### ALGORITHM

1. Define a custom exception class named IncorrectGuessError which will be raised for wrong guesses.
2.Prompt the user to guess a number.
3.If the user guesses correctly (i.e., the number 1), congratulate the user.
4.If the user guesses incorrectly, raise the IncorrectGuessError and display an error message.
5.End the program.

                break
            elif guess>secret:
                print("This value is too large, try again!")
                
                break
            else:
                print("This value is too small, try again!")
                break
        except value:
