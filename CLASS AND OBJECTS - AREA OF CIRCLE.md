## CLASS AND OBJECTS - AREA OF CIRCLE

---

### AIM  
To write a Python program to take the radius from the user and find the area of the circle using a class and function.
---


### ALGORITHM

1.Begin the program.

2.Create a class named Circle.

3.Define a method calculate_area() inside the class to compute the area of the circle using the formula:
           
           Area=ùúã √ó (radius)^2

4.In the main program, take the radius input from the user.

5.Create an object of the Circle class and call the calculate_area() method to get the area.

6.Display the area of the circle.

7.End the program.
